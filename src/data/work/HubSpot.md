Multiple roles in HubSpot's Infrastructure organization have allowed me to have significant, cross-team impact. As a Senior Software Engineer, I started on the Performance team responsible for the page load speed of over a thousand micro-frontends. Later, as a Senior Software Engineer II, I joined Reliability UX, becoming the owner of HubSpot's largest interal frontend application and the frontend monitoring experience.
